# Section 1
#### I am a big fan of the R code block shown below as it allows a point and click interface which removes ambiguity when selecting particular data sets.

``` {r pointclick_interface, eval = FALSE}
pointclick_interface <- read.table(file.choose(),header=TRUE,sep=",")
 
```

#### There are important aruments to control behavor of R code chunks in MD:
 - r : specifies language for code chunk
 - pointclick_interface : name of code chunk, this name needs to be unique
 - eval : if assigned TRUE the code will be evaluated


# Section 2
#### There are *__pre-loaded__* datasets on R studio. One of these is the *__'cars'__* dataset which includes variables such as speed and distance. See the code block below:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```


#### If you wanted to show a plot without R code you would type *__'echo = FALSE'__* into your code block


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, main = "Pressure vs Temperature Plot")
```


 - This plot was generated using datasets pre-loaded into R studio
 
# Section 3 
#### I'm running into near constant problems when trying to manipulate datasets surrounding the ongoing coronavirus pandemic
- I would love to be able to generate a package that manipulated some of this data, but it's not looking good so far.
