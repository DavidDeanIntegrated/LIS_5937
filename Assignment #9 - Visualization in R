#This assignment is focused on Visualization in R
#The three types of visualization include: basic, lattice and ggplot
#Access file of interest; downloaded from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html
#Item type of the downloaded data is 'Arrests' and the title is 'Arrests for Marijuana Possession'

#Import data set to R, this command leads to point and click interface to choose the file of interest
#Will choose file titled "Arrests"

mjdataset<- read.table(file.choose(),header=TRUE,sep=",")

#Generate graph with basic 'plot()' function
plot(mjdataset)
plot(mjdataset, main="Various graphs generated by plot function")

#Generate graph with lattice package
install.packages("lattice")
library(lattice)
mjplot <- xyplot(X~year, data=mjdataset, pch=".", main= "Incarcerated by Year Plot", ylab = "Inmate ID number", xlab = "Year Incarcerated")
print(mjplot)
#I didn't like this plot very much

#I liked this plot more
mjplot1 <- xyplot(year~age, data=mjdataset, pch=".",cex=3.0, main= "Incarcerated by Year Plot", ylab = "Year incarcerated", xlab = "Age incarcerated")
print(mjplot1)

#Generate graph with ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
newplot <- ggplot(mjdataset, aes(x=age, y=year))
newplot + geom_line(linetype=6)
